 * ============================================================================
 * Introduction
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * The Message Core plugin extends and builds upon the message functionality of
 * RPG Maker MZ and allows you, the game dev, to customize the workflow for
 * your game's message system.
 *
 * Features include all (but not limited to) the following:
 *
 * * Control over general message settings.
 * * Auto-Color key words and/or database entries.
 * * Increases the text codes available to perform newer functions/effects.
 * * Ability for you to implement custom Text Code actions.
 * * Ability for you to implement custom Text code string replacements.
 * * Invoke a macro system to speed up the dev process.
 * * Add a Text Speed option to the Options menu.
 * * Add the ever so useful Word Wrap to your message system.
 * * Extend the choice selection process to your liking.
 * * The ability to enable/disable as well as show/hide certain choices.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Requirements
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * This plugin is made for RPG Maker MZ. This will not work in other iterations
 * of RPG Maker.
 *
 * ------ Tier 1 ------
 *
 * This plugin is a Tier 1 plugin. Place it under other plugins of lower tier
 * value on your Plugin Manager list (ie: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). This is to ensure
 * that your plugins will have the best compatibility with the rest of the
 * VisuStella MZ library.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Major Changes
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * This plugin adds some new hard-coded features to RPG Maker MZ's functions.
 * The following is a list of them.
 *
 * ---
 * 
 * Dim Background Extension
 * 
 * Before, when using the Dim Background as a part of a Show Text event, its
 * size is only the same as the message window's width itself. This looked
 * really ugly because it had hard edges cutting off while gradients are seen
 * elsewhere. To make it look better, we extended the dimmed background to span
 * the width of the screen instead.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * Extended Messages
 * 
 * If you decide to expand the size of the message window to allow for more
 * rows to be displayed, you can type in the data for them by chaining together
 * Show Message events. They will take data from each other and display them in
 * the same message window as long as there are enough rows.
 * 
 * ---
 *
 * Extended Choice Lists
 * 
 * Choice lists can be extended by just chaining one Choice List event after
 * the other in succession along the same indentation. They do not extend if
 * there is any event other than a Choice List option between them on the same
 * indentation level.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Text Language Information
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * As of Message Core version 1.46, Text Language has been added. 
 * 
 * The "Text Language" feature allows your players to switch between different
 * languages for your game to allow people from around the globe to enjoy what
 * story you have to tell.
 * 
 * Disclaimers: This is not an automatic translation tool. Translations made
 * through the "Text Language" feature of the VisuStella MZ Message Core
 * will require manual input by the game developer.
 * 
 * As of Message Core version 1.53, we've decided to add support for TSV.
 * 
 * This is because we have done our research and decided that CSV's are too
 * restricted to use due to their default nature of wanting to use commas as
 * separators. Thus, we've decided to switch to TSV where the default separator
 * is a tab space, something that is almost never used in RPG Maker text.
 *
 * ---
 * 
 * === How to Enable Switching ===
 * 
 * Text Language is NOT enabled by default. Here's what you have to do:
 * 
 * #1. Open up the Message Core's Plugin Parameters
 * #2. Plugin Parameters > Text Language Settings > Enable Switching?
 * #3. Change the "Enable Switching?" parameter setting to "true".
 * #4. Adjust any other settings as needed.
 * #5. Save the Plugin Parameter changes.
 * #6. Save your game.
 * 
 * Now, it's time to get the CSV/TSV file that will contain all of the text
 * used to translate your game's script.
 * 
 * #1. Play test your game. Make sure Play test mode is NOT disabled.
 * #2. A popup will appear asking to create a language CSV/TSV file.
 * #3. Click "OK" and let the plugin do its thing.
 * #4. The project's /data/ folder will appear with Language.csv/tsv made.
 * #5. The plugin will then ask you to restart your game.
 * 
 * '''IMPORTANT!''' The separator used for the CSV file must be a semicolon (;)
 * and not a comma (,) as to reduce the amount of punctuation conflicts. Keep
 * this in mind as most CSV editors will default to comma (,) instead of the
 * semicolon (;) for their separator.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * === How to Edit the Language CSV/TSV ===
 * 
 * The Language CSV/TSV is structured as a normal CSV/TSV file would be, which
 * also means it can be modified in programs like Microsoft Excel or Google
 * Sheets. We recommend using either of those programs to modify the text.
 * 
 * We do not recommend modifying the CSV/TSV file in programs like notepad
 * directly due to the way certain things like commas (,) and tabs are handled
 * and how easy it is to be error-prone.
 * 
 * The table will appear something like this at first:
 * 
 *     Key        English    Chinese    Japanese     Korean
 *     Greeting   Hello      你好       こんにちは    안녕하세요
 *     Farewell   Good-bye   再见       さようなら    안녕히
 *     Wow        Wow        哇         ワオ          와우
 * 
 * The "Key" column refers to the reference key used to determine which lines
 * will be inserted into the text. The columns with the languages will utilize
 * the respective phrases for that language.
 * 
 * You can remove columns containing languages that you aren't planning to
 * translate for your game.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * === Things to Keep in Mind ===
 * 
 * When adding text to the CSV/TSV file via the spreadsheet editor (Excel or
 * Google Sheets), there's a few things to keep in mind.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * ==== How to Load the CSV/TSV in Google Sheets ====
 * 
 * If you are using Google Sheets and wish to edit the CSV/TSV without it
 * converting all the separators into commas, here's what you do:
 * 
 * #1. Go to "https://sheets.google.com"
 * #2. Create a "Blank spreadsheet"
 * #3. File > Import > Upload > Select the CSV/TSV file that was created in
 *     your game project's /data/ folder. You may need to select "All Files"
 *     for file type if uploading a TSV.
 * #4. For "Separator Type", if you are using CSV, change it to "Custom" and
 *     insert the Semicolon ";". Otherwise, if you are using TSV, select "tab"
 *     as your separator type.
 * #5. Uncheck "Convert text to numbers, dates, and formulas"
 * 
 * ==== How to Load the CSV/TSV in VS Code ===
 * 
 * #1. Go to "https://code.visualstudio.com/"
 * #2. Download and install it
 * #3. Open up VS Code and go to View > Extensions
 * #4. Search for an extension called "Edit CSV"
 * #5. Load the CSV/TSV file into VS Code and view with the CSV Editor
 * #6. Click the button that says "Edit CSV" in the upper right
 * 
 * ==== Line Breaks ====
 * 
 * When you want to insert line breaks into the translated phrases, use the
 * <br> text code. This is best used for text that is to be transferred into
 * the message window or help window.
 * 
 * ==== Text Codes ====
 * 
 * Text codes like \C[2] can be inserted normally. However, they only work in
 * windows that support text codes, such as the message window or help window.
 * Otherwise, the text codes will not transfer over properly.
 * 
 * ==== Semicolons (CSV Only) ====
 * 
 * Due to the nature of the CSV file, we used the semicolon (;) as the
 * separator. As such, semicolons should not be used in the text entries.
 * Though some sentences will work with the semicolon, not all of them will. If
 * you do want to use a semicolon, use the text code <semicolon> instead.
 * 
 *   Example:
 * 
 *   "The pancakes were delicious<semicolon> they were fluffy and sweet."
 * 
 * Other variations of the semicolon text code are <semi> and <semi-colon>.
 * The <semicolon> text code and variants only work with the Language CSV and
 * are ignored otherwise when typed in a regular message box entry.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * ==== Macros and Language Switches ====
 * 
 * For those using both text macros and text language switches, macros will be
 * converted to text before language switches as it allows for better text
 * transitions that way.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * === How to Use the Reference Keys ===
 * 
 * Remember the "Key" column and the reference keys? Those are used to
 * determine which lines will be inserted into the text for the message window
 * and just about any other window. However, there's a specific way these keys
 * must be used in order for them to work.
 * 
 * The "text code" format works like this. Use any of the following:
 * 
 *   \tl{keyName}
 *   \translate{keyName}
 *   \loc{keyName}
 *   \locale{keyName}
 *   \localize{keyName}
 * 
 * or for those coming from different translation plugins but want to switch
 * over to the VisuStella MZ Message Core's translation system:
 * 
 *   ${keyName}
 * 
 * For example, to use one of the default keys made with the Language CSV/TSV:
 * 
 *   \tl{Greeting}
 * 
 * This will yield "Hello" in English, "你好" in Chinese, "こんにちは" in
 * Japanese, and "안녕하세요" in Korean.
 * 
 * Key names are not case sensitive and any trailing spaces will be removed
 * from them in order to make sure the CSV/TSV table is stable to reference any
 * translated text from.
 * 
 * You can insert these language "text codes" into item names, skill names,
 * etc. as well as system entries like for Attack, Defense, etc.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * === Naming Weapon Types, Armor Types, Equip Types, Item Categories ===
 * 
 * You might have noticed that if you've decided to use \tl{keyName} for weapon
 * or other database types, other parts of the game will error out. Don't
 * worry, for these, you don't have to change the currently used database name.
 * Go straight to the CSV/TSV and insert in a new key for that particular
 * database name. For example, the equip type "Accessory" will use "Accessory"
 * as the automatic key to look for a translated phrase. If there isn't any in
 * the CSV/TSV file, then the default database text entry will be used.
 * 
 * ---
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Available Text Codes
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * The following are text codes that you may use with this plugin. Some of
 * these are original text codes provided by RPG Maker MZ, while others are
 * new text codes added through this plugin. You may even add your own text
 * codes through the plugin parameters.
 *
 * === RPG Maker MZ Text Codes ===
 *
 * The following are text codes that come with RPG Maker MZ. These text codes
 * cannot be edited through the Plugin Parameters.

 *
 * === Message Core Hard-Coded Text Codes ===
 *
 * The following text codes are hard-coded into VisuStella MZ Message Core's
 * code. These text codes cannot be edited through the Plugin Parameters.
 *

 *
 * ------------------   -------------------------------------------------------
 * Text Code            Effect (Global)
 * ------------------   -------------------------------------------------------
 * <b>                  Makes subsequent text bold.
 * </b>                 Removes bold from subsequent text.
 * <i>                  Makes subsequent text italic.
 * </i>                 Removes italic from subsequent text.
 * 
 * <left>               Makes subsequent text left-aligned. *Note1*
 * </left>              Removes left-alignment for subsequent text.
 * <center>             Makes subsequent text center-aligned. *Note1*
 * </center>            Removes center-alignment for subsequent text.
 * <right>              Makes subsequent text right-aligned. *Note1*
 * </right>             Removes right-alignment for subsequent text.
 *
 * Note1: Use at line-start. Does not work with Word Wrap.
 *
 * ---
 * 
 * ------------------   -------------------------------------------------------
 * Text Code            Effect (Global)
 * ------------------   -------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * <ColorLock>          Text codes can't change text color for subsequent text.
 * </ColorLock>         Removes Color Lock property.
 *
 * <WordWrap>           Enables Word Wrap for this window. *Note2*
 * </WordWrap>          Disables Word Wrap for this window. *Note2*
 * <br>                 Adds a line break. Requires Word Wrap enabled.
 * <line break>         Adds a line break. Requires Word Wrap enabled.
 *
 * Note2: Some windows cannot use Word Wrap such as the Choice Window.
 * Word Wrap also cannot be used together with <left>, <center>, or <right> and
 * will disable itself if text alignment text codes are detected.
 *
 * ---
 * 
 * ------------------   -------------------------------------------------------
 * Text Code            Effect (Global)
 * ------------------   -------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * \picture<x>          Draws picture x (filename) at current text position.
 * \CenterPicture<x>    Draws picture x (filename) centered at the window.
 * 
 * While these text codes are available globally, they are best suited for use
 * in the message window or any other window that does not change its contents.
 * The reason being is because the picture drawn is drawn into the background
 * of the window.
 * 
 * Therefore, we do not recommend using this in windows that change contents
 * often like Help Windows or Quest Descriptions. Instead, we recommend using
 * icons instead.
 * 
 * As of the version 1.53 update, the Help Window now supports both of these
 * text codes. However, we still recommend using icons over using pictures as
 * there will be loading delays.
 *
 * ---
 * 
 * ------------------   -------------------------------------------------------
 * Text Code            Effect (Map Name)
 * ------------------   -------------------------------------------------------
 * <left>               Makes map name align to left side of screen.
 * <center>             Makes map name align to horizontally center of screen.
 * <right>              Makes map name align to right side of screen.
 * 
 * <top>                Makes map name align to top of screen.
 * <middle>             Makes map name align to vertically middle of screen.
 * <bottom>             Makes map name align to bottom of screen.
 * 
 * <X: +n>              Adjusts the horizontal position of map name by n.
 * <X: -n>              Adjusts the horizontal position of map name by n.
 * 
 * <Y: +n>              Adjusts the vertical position of map name by n.
 * <Y: -n>              Adjusts the vertical position of map name by n.
 * 
 * Note: All of these text codes require VisuMZ_0_CoreEngine installed and its
 * "Map Name Text Code" plugin parameter enabled.
 *

 * 
 * ------------------   -------------------------------------------------------
 * Text Code            Effect (Global)
 * ------------------   -------------------------------------------------------
 * <Caps>               Makes all text after this capitalized.
 *                      Turns off other auto-text case modes.
 *                      ie: "hello world" becomes "HELLO WORLD"
 * </Caps>              Turns off auto text-casing effects.
 * 
 * <Upper>              Makes the first letter of any word after a space to be
 *                      capitalized. Other letters are left alone.
 *                      Turns off other auto-text case modes.
 *                      ie. "old mcDonald" becomes "Old McDonald"
 * </Upper>             Turns off auto text-casing effects.
 * 
 * <Lower>              Makes all text after this lowercase.
 *                      Turns off other auto-text case modes.
 *                      ie: "THE QUICK BROWN FOX" becomes "the quick brown fox"
 * </Lower>             Turns off auto text-casing effects.
 * 
 * <Alt>                Makes all text after this alternate between uppercase
 *                      and lowercase. Turns off other auto-text case modes.
 *                      ie: "Hello" becomes "HeLlO"
 * </Alt>               Turns off auto text-casing effects.
 * 
 * <Chaos>              Makes all text after this randomize between uppercase
 *                      and lowercase. Turns off other auto-text case modes.
 *                      ie: "Wassup" becomes "waSsUP" or "WasSuP"
 * </Chaos>             Turns off auto text-casing effects.
 * 
 * **Clarity:** In case you're wondering, the text codes </Caps>, </Upper>,
 * </Lower>, </Alt>, and </Chaos> all do the same thing and can be used
 * interchangeably with each other. For example, you can do this:
 * <Caps>hello world</Lower> and it would still accomplish the same effect, but
 * you won't do that because you're not a monster of a developer.

 * Text Code            Effect (Message Window Only)
 * ------------------   -------------------------------------------------------
 * \CommonEvent[x]      Runs common event x when text code is reached.
 * \Wait[x]             Makes the message wait x frames before continuing.
 * 
 * <Next Page>          Ends the current message page at this line. This is
 *                      used for messages when rows are at 5 or above and the
 *                      message lines don't match the amount. This is used to
 *                      prevent grabbing message windows from following message
 *                      events. Any lines following <Next Page> in the same
 *                      message event will be ignored.
 * 
 * <Auto>               Resizes message window dimensions to fit text. *Note3*
 * <Auto Width>         Resizes message window width to fit text. *Note3*
 * <Auto Height>        Resizes message window height to fit text. *Note3*
 * 
 * <Auto Actor: x>      Resizes message window and positions it over actor x
 *                      sprite's head. *Note3*
 * <Auto Party: x>      Resizes message window and positions it over party
 *                      member x sprite's head. *Note3*
 * <Auto Player>        Map-Only. Resizes message window and positions it over
 *                      the player sprite's head. *Note3*

 * Text Code                      Effect (Battle Only)
 * ----------------------------   ---------------------------------------------
 * <Current Battle Target>        Replaces text code with the current target of
 *                                an action in battle.
 * <Current Battle User>          Replaces text code with the currently active

 * ============================================================================
 * Plugin Parameters: Auto-Color Settings
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * For certain windows such as the Message Window, Help Window, and Choice
 * Window, Auto-Color is enabled to automatically highlight and color certain
 * database entries, keywords, and just about anything you, the game dev, wants
 * to be automatically colored. This is done to avoid typing out \C[6]Jack\C[0]
 * every time Jack's name is written out as it will be automatically colored in
 * those specific windows.
 *
 * The Plugin Parameters will give you full reign over which database entries
 * and keywords you want to be automatically colored as long as they follow a
 * few rules:
 * 
 * -----------------
 * Auto-Color Rules:
 * -----------------
 *
 * 1. Database names and keywords are case sensitive.
 *    This means if "Potion" is a marked keyword, typing out "potion" will not
 *    prompt the auto-color to highlight "potion". You must add the lowercase
 *    version of the word into the keyword list if you want it to count.
 *
 * 2. Database names and keywords are exact size (for Roman languages)
 *    This means if "Potion" is a marked keyword, typing out "potions" will not
 *    prompt the auto-color to highlight "potions". You must type out all of
 *    the variations of the words you want affected into the keyword list to
 *    prompt the auto-color highlight.
 * 
 *    This does not apply to Japanese, Korean, or Chinese languages.
 *
 * 3. Possessive cases and other language symbols aren't counted.
 *    Symbols such as periods, commas, quotes, parentheses, and similar symbols
 *    do no count towards Rule 2. This means if "Potion" is a marked keyword,
 *    the typing out "(Potion)" will still highlight the "Potion" part of the
 *    word according to the auto-color.
 * 
 * 4. Names with special characters like !, ?, [, ], etc. will be ignored.
 *    These cause conflicts with how auto-colors are detected.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Database Highlighting
 *
 *   Actors:
 *   Classes:
 *   Skills:
 *   Items:
 *   Weapons:
 *   Armors:
 *   Enemies:
 *   States:
 *   - Any usage of a the selected database entry's name is auto-colored with
 *     the text code number.
 *   - Use 0 to not auto-color.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Word Highlighting
 *
 *   \C[x]: Color
 *   - These are lists of all the words that will be automatically colored with
 *     the x text color.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Plugin Parameters: Custom Font Manager
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Custom fonts that aren't the message or number fonts cannot be used without
 * registration. If you try to use custom fonts in RPG Maker MZ without
 * registering their font family first, you will find out that they will not
 * work. These plugin parameters allow you to register your game's custom fonts
 * here.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * Settings:
 * 
 *   Font Family:
 *   - This will be what's used by RPG Maker MZ and plugins to reference this
 *     specific font.
 *   - NO filename extensions!
 * 
 *   Filename:
 *   - What is the filename of the custom font you would like to use?
 *   - Located inside the project's "fonts" folder.
 * 
 * ---
 * 
 * Examples:
 * 
 *   Font Family: WildWords
 *   Filename: WildWords-Regular.ttf
 * 
 * How you would use this in other plugins as a preface to the font face or
 * font family would be to use "WildWords" as the font face/family name. Then
 * RPG Maker MZ will use its own innate FontManager to refer that to the
 * "WildWords-Regular.ttf" file found in the game's "fonts" folder.
 * 
 * ---
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Plugin Parameters: Text Code Actions
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Text codes are used for one of two things: performing actions or replacing
 * themselves with text data. This Plugin Parameter will focus on the aspect of
 * performing actions. These actions can be done through each JavaScript or by
 * a common event (if it is used in the Message Window). Adequate knowledge of
 * both is recommended before attempting to modify and/or add new Text Code
 * Actions to the Plugin Parameters.
 *
 * Each of the Text Code Actions are formatted in such a way:
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Text Code Action
 *
 *   Match:
 *   - This is what needs to be matched in order for this text code to work.
 *   - This is the primary text marker after the \ in a text code.
 *   - In \N[x], this would be the 'N'.
 *
 *   Type:
 *   - The type of parameter to obtain (none, number, or string).
 *   - This is the way the text code determines the condition type.
 *   - In \N[x], this would be the '[x]'.
 *
 *   Common Event:
 *   - Select a common event to run when this text code is used in a message.
 *
 *   JS: Action:
 *   - JavaScript code used to perform an action when this text code appears.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Plugin Parameters: Text Code Replacements
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Text codes are used for one of two things: performing actions or replacing
 * themselves with text data. This Plugin Parameter will focus on the aspect of
 * replacing the text codes with text data. Text data can be replaced with
 * an exact exchange of text or dynamically through JavaScript. Adding a new
 * Text Code Replacement is done through the Plugin Parameters.
 *
 * Each of the Text Code Replacements are formatted in such a way:
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Text Code Replacement
 *
 *   Match:
 *   - This is what needs to be matched in order for this text code to work.
 *   - This is the primary text marker after the \ in a text code.
 *   - In \N[x], this would be the 'N'.
 *
 *   Type:
 *   - The type of parameter to obtain (none, number, or string).
 *   - This is the way the text code determines the condition type.
 *   - In \N[x], this would be the '[x]'.
 *
 *   STR: Text:
 *   - The text that will appear if this match appears.
 *     If this has a value, ignore the JS: Text version.
 *
 *   JS: Text:
 *   - JavaScript code used to determine the text that will appear if this
 *     match appears.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Plugin Parameters: Text Macros
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Text macros are used in similar fashion to text codes replacements to
 * replace themselves with text data. The primary difference is that macros are
 * made in a different format with no conditional argument modifiers (ie the
 * [x] that follows a text code).
 *
 * To use a text macro, type in the matching keyword between two [brackets] and
 * it will be replaced by the string data or run the JavaScript code found in
 * the Plugin Parameter settings.
 *
 * For example, if you have the text macro "Leader", made to return the party
 * leader's name, you can type in [Leader] in the Message Window and it will be
 * replaced with the party leader's name. The output can also output text codes
 * into the resulting text.
 * 
 * This does NOT work with \MacroName as it did with Yanfly Engine Plugins.
 * Use the method stated before with the brackets to [MacroName] instead.
 *
 * Each of the Text Macros are formatted in such a way:
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Text Macro
 *
 *   Match:
 *   - This is what needs to be matched in order for this macro to work.
 *   - In [Leader], this would be the 'Leader' text.
 *
 *   STR: Text:
 *   - The replacement text that will appear from the macro.
 *   - If this has a value, ignore the JS: Text version.
 *
 *   JS: Text:
 *   - JavaScript code used to determine the text that will appear if this
 *     macro appears.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Plugin Parameters: Text Language Settings

 *
 * The "Text Language" feature allows your players to switch between different
 * languages for your game to allow people from around the globe to enjoy what
 * story you have to tell.
 * 
 * Disclaimers: This is not an automatic translation tool. Translations made
 * through the "Text Language" feature of the VisuStella MZ Message Core

 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Plugin Parameters: Language Images
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Allows different images to be used when different languages are used. This
 * is for images that have text on it that you want to appear in different
 * languages based on the text language selected by the player.
 * 
 * There are two ways this works:
 * 
 *   #1: Folder Name
 *   - The name of the folder containing those images will be named something
 *     like "Scrolls[XX]"
 *   - When a different language is picked, like English, it can reference
 *     the 'Scrolls[EN]' folder instead. If Japanese is used, it can refer to
 *     the 'Scrolls[JP]' folder as well.
 *   - The text used to replace the [XX] in the folder name can be determined
 *     in the Plugin Parameters.
 *     - Make sure you change the settings for each language you wish to use to
 *       have translated images for.
 * 
 *   #2: Filename
 *   - The filename of the image to be translated can be named something like
 *     ReidProfile[XX].png
 *   - When a different language is picked, like English, it will reference the
 *     'ReidProfile[EN].png' image instead. For Japanese, it will reference the
 *     'ReidProfile[JP].png' as well.
 *   - The text used to replace the [XX] in the filename can be determined in
 *     the Plugin Parameters.
 *     - Make sure you change the settings for each language you wish to use to
 *       have translated images for.
 *
 * ---
 * 
 * Settings
 * 
 *   Convert Default?
 *   - ON: Default language uses converted marker.
 *   - OFF: Default languages uses [XX] as marker.
 * 
 * Here's an explanation of what this does:
 * 
 *   - The default language picked is English and the player has English picked
 *     as their desired language.
 *   - If the "Convert Default?" Plugin Parameter is ON, then 'ReidProfile[XX]'
 *     will reference and look for the 'ReidProfile[EN]' image.
 *   - If the "Convert Default?" Plugin Parameter is OFF, 'ReidProfile[XX]' is
 *     then used for the English language instead of 'ReidProfile[EN]'.
 *     - This is to avoid duplicate images and save on file space.
 *   - The reasoning behind the [XX] is that there needs to be an anchor image
 *     used for the RPG Maker MZ client in order to have something to reference
 *     before branching out to different languages.

 * 
 * ============================================================================
 * Plugin Parameters: Word Wrap Settings
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Word wrap is a property that will cause any overflowing text to wrap around
 * and move into the next line. This property can only be enabled inside text
 * that accept text codes, such as the Message Window and Help Window. However,
 * word wrap is disabled for the Choice Window due to the nature of the Choice
 * Window's base properties.
 *
 * Word wrap can be enabled or disabled in three ways. One is by using the text
 * code <WordWrap> to enable it or </WordWrap> to disable it. The second method
 * is by enabling it with the Plugin Command: 'Message: Properties'. The third
 * method is by enabling it by default with the Plugin Parameters.
 * 
 * Word wrap only supports left-to-right alphabetical languages that utilize
 * spaces.
 * 
 * Word Wrap also cannot be used together with <left>, <center>, or <right> and
 * will disable itself if text alignment text codes are detected.
 * 
 * As of the v1.44 update, some Asian languages such as Chinese and Japanese
 * are now supported for word wrap. Korean language is only supported if spaces
 * are used.
 * 
 * ---
 *
 * Enable Word Wrap
 *
 *   Message Window:
 *   - Automatically enable Word Wrap for this window?
 *
 *   Help Window:
 *   - Automatically enable Word Wrap for this window?
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Rules
 *
 *   Link Break -> Space:
 *   - Convert manually placed (non tagged) line breaks with spaces?
 *   - Line breaks must be inserted using the <br> text code.
 *
 *   Tight Wrap:
 *   - If a face graphic is present in a message, word wrap will be tighter.
 * 
 *   End Padding:
 *   - Add extra padding to your window to make text wrap further away from the
 *     end of the window.
 *   - This will default to 0.

 * 
 * Version 1.55: January 19, 2026
 * * Documentation Update!
 * ** \ChangeFace<x,y> text codegets a note added:
 * *** This text code is used under the assumption that you are using an
 *     existing face graphic to change from (doesn't matter which). The text
 *     code will not automatically shift text from no-face graphic to having a
 *     face graphic mid-message.
 * 
 * Version 1.54: May 15, 2025
 * * Bug Fixes!
 * ** Fixed a bug where the text width of translated text was not taken into
 *    account. Fix made by Arisu
 * 
 * Version 1.53: February 20, 2025, 2025
 * * Bug Fixes!
 * ** Fixed an error with text language translations not working properly for
 *    the last listed language in the translation sheet. Fix made by Irina.
 * * Compatibility Update!
 * ** Updated for RPG Maker MZ Core Scripts 1.9.0!
 * *** Removed picture limit of 100 from Picture-related Plugin Commands.
 * * Documentation Update!
 * ** Help file updated for new features.
 * ** Text Language Information section included for TSV.
 * ** Updated text code note for \picture<x> and \CenterPicture<x>
 * *** As of the version 1.53 update, the Help Window now supports both of
 *     these text codes. However, we still recommend using icons over using
 *     pictures as there will be loading delays.
 * * Plugin Parameters
 * ** New plugin parameters added by Irina:
 * *** Parameters > Text Language Settings > File Type:
 * **** Which file type do you wish to use?
 * ***** CSV (Legacy)
 * ***** TSV (Recommended)
 * *** Parameters > Text Language Settings > TSV Filename
 * **** What is the filename of the TSV file to read from?
 * **** Located within the project's /data/ folder.
 * * Feature Updates!
 * ** We have done our research and decided that CSV's are too restricted to
 *    use due to their default nature of wanting to use commas as separators.
 *    Thus, we've decided to switch to TSV where the default separator is a tab
 *    space, something that is almost never used in RPG Maker text.
 * ** CSV support will remain as a legacy option but TSV will be recommended as
 *    the main text languaging switching filetype.
 * ** When creating a new Language TSV, the plugin will check if a Language CSV
 *    exists and asks you if you wish to convert the existing CSV to TSV. The
 *    original CSV file will remain intact as a backup.
 * 
 * Version 1.52: December 19, 2024
 * * Documentation Update!
 * ** Help file updated for new features.
 * * New Features!
 * ** New Text Codes added by Arisu:
 * *** <left>
 * *** <center>
 * *** <right>
 * **** When used in the Map Name, instead of aligning the text which is
 *      centered by default, the text code will align the horizontal position
 *      of the name displayed on the screen.
 * *** <top>
 * *** <middle>
 * *** <bottom>
 * **** When used in the Map Name, the text code will align the vertical
 *      position of the name displayed on the screen.
 * *** <X: +n>
 * *** <X: -n>
 * *** <Y: +n>
 * *** <Y: -n>
 * **** Adjusts the horizontal/vertical position of map name by 'n' value.
 * *** All of these text codes require VisuMZ_0_CoreEngine installed and its
 *     "Map Name Text Code" plugin parameter enabled.
 * 
 * Version 1.51: October 17, 2024
 * * Bug Fixes!
 * ** Fixed a bug where \LastGainObj text code did not work with text language
 *    key codes. Fix made by Irina.
 * * Documentation Update!
 * ** Help file updated for new features.
 * ** Added note to Text Language Information > How to Enable Switching
 * *** IMPORTANT! The separator used for the CSV file must be a semicolon (;)
 *     and not a comma (,) as to reduce the amount of punctuation conflicts.
 *     Keep this in mind as most CSV editors will default to comma (,) instead
 *     of the semicolon (;) for their separator.
 * ** Added note to Text Language Information > Naming Weapon Types, etc:
 * *** You might have noticed that if you've decided to use \tl{keyName} for
 *     weapon or other database types, other parts of the game will error out.
 *     Don't worry, for these, you don't have to change the currently used
 *     database name. Go straight to the CSV and insert in a new key for that
 *     particular database name. For example, the equip type "Accessory" will
 *     use "Accessory" as the automatic key to look for a translated phrase. If
 *     there isn't any in the CSV file, then the default database text entry
 *     will be used.
 * * New Features!
 * ** New Plugin Parameters added by Irina:
 * *** Parameters > Text Language Settings > Language Fonts
 * **** Different default fonts used for different languages. This allows
 *      different stylistic choices to be made for different languages in case
 *      the current font you're using doesn't have support for other language
 *      types.
 * **** Keep in mind that players can override this with Options Core if they
 *      select a text option other than 'Default' for the 'Text Font' option.
 * **** Make sure any new custom fonts used for different languages are
 *      registered with the 'Custom Font Manager' found in this plugin's Plugin
 *      Parameters.
 * *** Parameters > Text Language Settings > Language Images
 * **** Allows different images to be used when different languages are used.
 *      This is for images that have text on it that you want to appear in
 *      different languages based on the text language selected by the player.
 * 
 * Version 1.50: July 18, 2024
 * * Documentation Update!
 * ** Help file updated for new features.
 * * New Features!
 * ** New text codes added by Irina:
 * *** <Caps> </Caps>
 * *** <Upper> </Upper>
 * *** <Lower> </Lower>
 * **** Auto-text case textcodes will automatically adjust text inserted
 *      between them to respectively be completely capitalized, first-letter
 *      capitalized, or completely lowercase.
 * **** More information in the help file.
 * *** <Alt> </Alt>

 * * Feature Update!
 * ** Auto Color Plugin Parameters now have their default settings set to 0.
 *    This is due to an influx of "bug reports" from users who do not
 *    understand how this feature works, and the VisuStella team has decided it
 *    is better for the feature to default to an inactive state until users
 *    decide to search and utilize it themselves. Update made by Irina.
 * 
 * Version 1.09: January 1, 2021

 *     not want the input to be cleared, use a different key.
 * ** Updated help file for new features.
 * * Feature Update!
 * ** The default Fast Forward Key setting has now been changed from "Shift" to

 *    account before sending it to the bottom of the message window. Fix made
 *    by Yanfly.
 * ** Added automatic feature setting to turn off word wrap when using the
 *    auto-size and auto-position text codes. This is because the auto-size and
 *    auto-position effects don't work properly with Word Wrap based on how

 * ** New message pages after auto-sizing no longer put out empty messages.
